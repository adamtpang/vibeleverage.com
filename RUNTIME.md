## Agent execution adapters (Summon lanes)

| Lane | When to use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Default deep work while quota remains | Resets weekly; hand off via sync |
| Codex | When Claude is exhausted | Keep `AGENTS.md` / `CODEX_CONTINUE_FROM_CLAUDE.md` current |
| Grok | When Claude and Codex are exhausted | `node .grok/sync-to-grok.js` then read `GROK_CONTINUE_FROM_*.md` |

Strong default model: whatever the active adapter's best coding model is.
Low-reasoning lane: short, bounded tasks (lint, rename, one-file edits) on a fast model when available.

## Health proof

After each ship, record in `EVIDENCE.md`: URL or command, status code / screenshot, date.
